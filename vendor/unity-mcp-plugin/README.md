# Unity MCP Plugin — AI-Powered Unity Editor Bridge (UPM Package)

> **The Unity Editor side of the most comprehensive [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) integration for Unity game development.** Install via Unity Package Manager to let Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, or any MCP-compatible AI assistant control your Unity Editor with **288 tools** across **30+ categories**. Built and maintained by [AnkleBreaker Studio](https://github.com/AnkleBreaker-Studio).

## What It Does

This package runs a lightweight HTTP bridge inside the Unity Editor on `localhost:7890`. The companion [Unity MCP Server](https://github.com/AnkleBreaker-Studio/unity-mcp-server) connects to it, exposing **288 tools** to AI assistants across **30+ feature categories** — scenes, GameObjects, components, builds, profiling, Shader Graph, Amplify Shader Editor, terrain, physics, NavMesh, animation, multiplayer, and much more.

### Neon Brick Breaker — Built from scratch by AI in under 5 minutes
> Claude creates the entire game: scene setup, neon materials with bloom post-processing, brick grid layout, game scripts, VFX, and UI — all through Unity MCP commands.

Unity will download and install the package. You should see in the Console:
```
[MCP Bridge] Server started on port 7890
```

### Verify

Open a browser and visit: `http://127.0.0.1:7890/api/ping`

You should see JSON with your Unity version and project name.

## Companion: MCP Server

This plugin is one half of the system. You also need the **Node.js MCP Server** that connects Claude to this bridge:

👉 [unity-mcp-server](https://github.com/AnkleBreaker-Studio/unity-mcp-server)

## Dashboard

Open **Window > MCP Dashboard** to access:

- Server status with live indicator (green = running, red = stopped)
- Start / Stop / Restart controls
- Per-category feature toggles (enable/disable any of the 30+ categories)
- Port and auto-start settings
- Active agent session monitoring
- Version display with update checker

## Requirements

- Unity 2021.3 LTS or newer (tested on 2022.3 LTS and Unity 6)
- .NET Standard 2.1 or .NET Framework

### Optional Packages

Some features activate automatically when their corresponding packages are detected:

### Cost Comparison

> **AnkleBreaker Unity MCP is completely free and open source.** The prices below reflect only the cost of the AI assistant (Claude) itself — the MCP plugin and server are $0.

| Solution | Monthly Cost | What You Get |
|----------|:----------:|--------------| 
| **AnkleBreaker MCP (free) + Claude Pro** | **$20/mo** | 288 tools, full Unity control, open source — MCP is free, price is Claude only |
| **AnkleBreaker MCP (free) + Claude Max 5x** | **$100/mo** | Same + 5x usage for heavy workflows — MCP is free, price is Claude only |
| **AnkleBreaker MCP (free) + Claude Max 20x** | **$200/mo** | Same + 20x usage for teams/studios — MCP is free, price is Claude only |
| **Bezi Pro** | $20/mo | ~30 tools, 800 credits/mo, freezes Unity |
| **Bezi Advanced** | $60/mo | ~30 tools, 2400 credits/mo, freezes Unity |
| **Bezi Team** | $200/mo | 3 seats, 8000 credits, still freezes Unity |
| **Unity AI** | Included with Unity Pro/Enterprise | Limited AI tools, Unity Points system, no MCP |
| **Coplay MCP** | Free (beta) | 34 tools, basic categories |

### Key Advantages

**vs. Bezi:**
Bezi runs as a proprietary Unity plugin with its own credit-based billing — $20–$200/mo on top of your AI subscription. It has historically suffered from freezing the Unity Editor during AI tasks, blocking your workflow. AnkleBreaker MCP is completely free and open source, runs entirely in the background with zero editor impact, and offers 8x more tools — the only cost is your existing Claude subscription.

**vs. Coplay MCP:**
Coplay MCP provides 34 tools across ~5 categories. AnkleBreaker MCP delivers 288 tools across 30+ categories including advanced features like physics raycasts, terrain editing, shader graph management, profiling, NavMesh, particle systems, and MPPM multiplayer — none of which exist in Coplay. Our two-tier lazy loading system is specifically optimized for Claude Cowork's tool limits.

**vs. Unity AI:**
Unity AI (successor to Muse) is built into Unity 6.2+ but limited to Unity's own AI models and a credit-based "Unity Points" system. It cannot be used with Claude or any external AI assistant, has no MCP support, and offers a fraction of the automation capabilities. AnkleBreaker MCP works with any MCP-compatible AI while giving you full control over which AI models you use.

## What's New in v2.33.0 → v2.39.1

- **ProBuilder integration** — 14 `probuilder/*` commands over ProBuilder's real API (parametric shapes, face edits, boolean CSG with source cleanup + naming, combine, probuilderize, mesh export), gated on `PROBUILDER_INSTALLED` so projects without ProBuilder get a clear message instead of a compile error. Every mutation is Undo-tracked.
- **Per-action / per-agent undo** — the queue wraps every write in its own named Undo group; `undo/last` reverts a whole action (per-agent aware, linear-undo honest), `undo/history` is a per-agent action log.
- **Studio news notifications** — a mobile-style unseen badge on the MCP toolbar element for new AnkleBreaker devlog posts (6h RSS poll, per-user read state, opt-out in Settings), news in the toolbar dropdown and the dashboard.
- **Dashboard reworked in UI Toolkit** — Window → AB Unity MCP rebuilt on the studio theme (shared brand stylesheet), preserving every feature and adding the news panel; sections self-heal and refresh on content change only.
- **Correctness** — locale-proof numeric args (non-integer params were silently dropped on decimal-comma locales; present-but-invalid now errors loudly, `create-shape` echoes applied size/position), `probuilder/info` world bounds, dense `scene/hierarchy` (absent field = default; `verbose:true` restores), scene-capture camera sync for backgrounded editors.
- **Data safety** — shared path confinement (`Assets/`/`Packages/` only), overwrite guards on every asset creator (`overwrite:true` to replace), script create/update source-loss vectors closed, queue drops timed-out tickets before execution (no double-runs), ShaderGraph create/edit through the real `GraphData` model (all four corruption bugs from #18 fixed).
- **Generated route registry** — `MCPBridgeServer.Routes.g.cs` generated from the dispatch switch with a CI drift check (337 routes).

## What's New in v2.32.0

- **Editor-window screenshots (`screenshot/editor-window`)** — capture any EditorWindow (Inspector, Project, Console, custom windows) to a PNG via the Win32 `PrintWindow` API. Occlusion-proof (the window renders itself offscreen — no raising or focus-stealing), with automatic docked-vs-floating handling. Defaults to `Assets/Screenshots/`, accepts any `.png` path. **Windows editor only** (`#if UNITY_EDITOR_WIN`) — on macOS/Linux it returns a clear "unsupported platform" error (PrintWindow has no equivalent there); use scene/game capture, which are camera-based and cross-platform. Companion to `unity-mcp-server` v2.30.0.
- **Welcome window reworked** — the single-file welcome window is replaced by a modular, themed system (`UnityMCP.Editor.Welcome` assembly): USS theme, Welcome + Studio tabs, auto-open on first load with per-project detection, a config-driven content seam, and a devlog feed.

## What's New in v2.27.0

- **Path-based lookup works on inactive GameObjects** — Every tool that accepts a `path` (`prefab_info`, `set_active`, `info`, `delete`, `set_transform`, `reparent`, etc.) now correctly finds and operates on inactive targets, where previously it silently failed with "GameObject not found". Fix contributed by [@BadranRaza](https://github.com/BadranRaza).
- **Prefab-instance detection fixed on scene instances** — `prefab_info` no longer falsely reports valid scene prefab instances as "not a prefab instance". Switched to `PrefabUtility.IsPartOfPrefabInstance`, the authoritative API. Fix contributed by [@BadranRaza](https://github.com/BadranRaza).
- **Bridge no longer runs in batch-mode subprocesses** — The plugin previously started its HTTP bridge inside every `AssetImportWorker` Unity spawned for parallel asset import, claiming ports on top of the main Editor and exhausting the 7890-7899 range. It now detects batch mode and stays out of the way.
- **Port-discovery infinite loop fixed** — When no port was available, the plugin would spam `Failed to start on port 7890` forever. It now gives up cleanly and logs a single actionable error.

## What's New in v2.26.0

- **SpriteAtlas management** — 7 new HTTP endpoints for creating, inspecting, adding/removing sprites, configuring settings, deleting, and listing SpriteAtlases. Contributed by [@zaferdace](https://github.com/zaferdace).
- **Self-test system overhaul** — Probes for all 43 command modules, robust test runner with domain reload resume and timeout handling.
- **Unity 2023+ / Unity 6 compatibility** — Resolved 43 `CS0618` deprecation warnings across the codebase.

## What's New in v2.24.0

- **Compilation error tracking** — New dedicated compilation error buffer powered by `CompilationPipeline.assemblyCompilationFinished`. Captures errors and warnings per assembly with file, line, column, message, and severity. Independent of the console log buffer — not affected by `Clear()` or Play Mode log flooding. Auto-clears on each new compilation cycle via `compilationStarted`. Exposed via the `compilation/errors` HTTP route for the MCP server's `unity_get_compilation_errors` tool.

## What's New in v2.21.1

- **Port affinity** — The plugin now remembers its last-used port via EditorPrefs and attempts to reclaim it on restart. This prevents port swaps when multiple Unity projects are open — each editor consistently uses the same port across restarts.
- **Enriched ping response** — The `/api/ping` endpoint now returns `projectPath` alongside the existing `projectName`, enabling the MCP server to validate instance identity by both name and path.
- **Registry heartbeat** — A new heartbeat mechanism updates the `lastSeen` timestamp in the shared instance registry every 30 seconds. This lets the MCP server distinguish between a compiling editor (fresh entry, temporarily unresponsive) and a crashed editor (stale entry, no heartbeat for >5 minutes).
- **Crash resilience** — Combined with the server-side staleness check, the heartbeat ensures that if Unity crashes mid-compile and `OnDisable` never fires, the stale registry entry is detected and cleared within 5 minutes, allowing proper re-discovery.
